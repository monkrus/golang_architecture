Samurai
Michael Cretu

If you're lonely
You never show a sign
No devotion could ever change your mind
No illusion when your work is done

Nobody knows you
Nobody knows your name
Nobody knows you
Samurai samurai

Did you ever dream
Hesitate wonder why
At all the anger you have seen
Oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh
Samurai samurai

Does your blood run cold
No light shines in your eyes
No burning flame in your soul
Oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh

Your commission was written in the sand
No emotion could ever stay your hand
No consolation no word of love or praise

Your fight is over
Your enemies are gone
Your fight is overstay your hand
